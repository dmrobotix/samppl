We have very good news tonight. We have tested our base mounted with our tank treads and Pololu wheels. The videos are below. You can see that our robot can do tank turns with ease and moves forward with fairly good speed at 50% duty cycle.

We have some minor modifications to do to the mounts on the non-motor wheels but otherwise we are very happy with the results and look forward to driving Pink Droid as a tank.
