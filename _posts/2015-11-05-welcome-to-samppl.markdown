Welcome to our team website. Here you can find our work calendar and follow our team's progress. Our team is called __S.A.M. People__, a play on "sand people", a moniker used to refer to the Tuskgen Raiders in *Star Wars*. Our humble 'droid is known as, *__Pink Droid - The Rebel Scum__*.

There are three design reviews that our robot must pass. The first design review took place today in class when each team presented their best design and received feedback from our professor and the TAs. Below are our three designs (click the image to see a larger version):
